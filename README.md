#INA3221 STM32 Library

This library provides an interface for the INA3221 current and voltage sensor using DMA for efficient data acquisition on STM32 microcontrollers. Initially developed and tested on the STM32F4CEU6 Black Pill, it allows streamlined monitoring of voltage and current on three channels via the INA3221 sensor, utilizing DMA to reduce CPU load and improve performance. The library also includes an overcurrent protection feature for added safety.
